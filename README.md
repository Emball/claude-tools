<p align="center"><em>Designed for Claude by Claude. They say we're soulmates!</em></p>

</h1>



<p align="center">A Chromium extension companion to Claude.ai that adds several features catered to power users. No ads, no telemetry, clean UI.</p>

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emball/claudette.git
```

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode**
2. Click **Load unpacked** → select the `claudette` folder

**To update:** `git pull` inside the folder, then hit **↻** on the Claudette card in `chrome://extensions`.

## Chat Exporter

Export any Claude.ai conversation as Markdown or plain text, instantly, using your existing session — no waiting for the official data export pipeline.

**Single chat** — download button in the top bar of any open conversation.

**Bulk** — on the `/chats` page, check conversations and hit **Export** in the selection bar.

**Output:**
- No images → bare `.md` / `.txt`
- Images present → `.zip` with the file and all images flat at the root (so `![image.png](./image.png)` embeds automatically when you open the MD)
- Bulk → single `.zip`, all files flat at root, image filenames prefixed with their conversation title to avoid collisions

## What gets exported

| Content | Format |
|---|---|
| Messages | `**User:**` / `**Assistant:**` inline |
| Tool calls & output | `> **Action title**` blockquote + fenced block |
| Thinking blocks | `> *italic blockquote*` *(toggle: off by default)* |
| Artifacts | Fenced code block with filename as first-line comment |
| Uploaded files | `*<File: name.ext>*` + fenced block |
| Pasted text | `*<Pasted>*` + fenced block |
| Screenshots (OCR on) | `*<Screenshot: name>*` + extracted text in fenced block |
| Screenshots (OCR off) | `*<Screenshot: name>*` + embedded in ZIP |
| Photos | `*<Photo: name>*` + `![name](./name)` |

Fences auto-extend if content contains backticks, so nested code blocks never break the export.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| Format | MD | `.md` or `.txt` |
| Include thinking | Off | Extended reasoning blocks |
| Include tool calls | On | Tool invocations and output |
| Include images | On | Process images at all |
| ↳ Use OCR | Off | OCR on screenshots (slow) |
| ↳ Package in ZIP | On | Save images to ZIP |
| ZIP non-image files | On | Bundle uploaded files into ZIP |

## Coming soon

**Session Chaining** — a local conversation library. Every chat you open gets absorbed into a local index. Chains are named groups of sessions; spawning a new chain chat injects the full prior context so Claude picks up seamlessly. Powers full-text search across your entire history.

**Prompt Library** — store and inject reusable prompts into the input box.

---

## Technical

- **Auth:** session cookie only — no API keys, no OAuth
- **API:** Claude's internal undocumented endpoints (same ones the frontend uses — may break on Anthropic UI changes)
- **OCR:** Tesseract.js v5 in a hidden extension-origin iframe; `eng.traineddata` cached in IndexedDB after first run
- **Concurrency:** 3 parallel conversation fetches, 3 parallel OCR jobs, memory ceiling to prevent tab crashes
